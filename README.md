### What is it?
Simple! If you think one trident is fun, how about a bunch? With different power levels and abilities, find a bunch of new tridents in chests around the world, or craft some yourself!

Also utilize a variety of other aquatic tools and weapons, such as the Harpoon Launcher, an underwater Bow variant that launches and consumes harpoons, craftable projectiles with various attributes of their own!

### Features Include
* A variety of new tridents
* Find in loot chests, as rare drops, and craft them!
* Other aquatic weapons and tools

### Roadmap
Initial release will have a respectable variety of tridents and other tools. I plan to add to the collection bit by bit as I update.
